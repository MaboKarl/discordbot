I use that context to give you consistent answers. |\n| 2 | **What happens after the chat ends** | I do **not** retain any of the messages or details once the session is closed. Nothing is stored for future reference. |\n| 3 | **Token‑limit mechanics** | Even while a session is open, I’m limited to roughly 4096–8192 tokens (text units). If the total of your messages + my answers exceeds that, the earliest parts are dropped. |\n| 4 | **Privacy / no shared storage** | None of your inputs are stored in a database or used to train me—everything is processed in real time and then discarded after the session. |\n\nIf you’d like more detail on any of these points—or if there’s another topic you have in mind—just let me know!"

When it’s exceeded, the oldest tokens are dropped. |\n| 4 | **Privacy & storage** | No messages are stored in a database or used for training; everything is discarded once the session closes. |\n| 5 | **User‑requested summary** | I gave a formatted “per‑topic” summary of points 1‑4. |\n\nSo, in short: we talked about how I handle memory, the limits of that memory, and privacy, and then you asked me to recap those points — which I just did."
